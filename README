This is really just a conkyrc config which is 
configured to display the contents of a ToDo list from a simple text file on your desktop. 
I realize that you can just open the text file and edit it in a number of ways, cli or gui, but I 
wanted to have a simple C# project to get familiar with GTK#/Mono. I have included a similar Java Swing 
app as well. My hope is simply that someone will find it useful.

Requirements:
-------------
You need to have conky installed, obviously.
To use the C# editor you will need the Mono runtime.
To use the Java editor you will need a Java runtime environment.

Instructions for conky:
-----------------------
1. Move the folder 'conkyToDo' to .conky directory in your home  directory

2. You can start conky with this config with the command:
	conky -c ~/.conky/conkyrc_todo

3. In Ubuntu, you can have this conky config auto-start by adding an entry under  Settings --> Startup Applications

4. Changes to your .todo file file be displayed in conky. It is set to update every .5 seconds, of course, you can change this.

Instructions for Editors:
-------------------------
The C# Monodevelop project is in the ToDo folder. The current executable is in ToDo/ToDo/bin/Release/.
 The .exe can be run with the following command:
	mono ToDo.exe
http://monodevelop.com/

The Java source file and compiled class file are in the Java folder.
The class file can be run with the command:
	java ToDo.

The net folder contains the Swing Miglayout files and is required for the current layout of the GUI.
MigLayout is THE Layout manager for Java. is dual-licensed under the BSD or GPL. the latest version can be found here:
